# Data Science Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic & self learning. Mostly presented in the form of jupyter Notebooks.

_Note: Data used in the projects (accessed under data directory) is for demonstration purposes only._

## Contents

- ### Machine Learning
  - [Anomaly Detection: UBC Capstone Project for PayByPhone Technologies Inc.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HTcqftMtsu3ppLieiISWi6FGRQsibaeLaa3krNCqgpA/edit?usp=sharing) **Presentation demo request**. Developed a customized Python package to automatically detect abnormal transactions in time series, restructured the anomaly detection process at PayByPhone.
  - [Regression Prediction: Energy Consumption Prediction (residential_energy_consumption_prediction)](https://github.com/nichowu/residential_energy_consumption_prediction_2009): Developed a model that predicts annual energy consumption of a household in 2009 in the U.S. 
  - [Binary Classification: Porto Seguro Safe Driver Prediction](https://github.com/nichowu/Porto-Seguro-Safe-Driver-Prediction/blob/main/Phase4_Feature_Engineering%26Modelling.ipynb): A model to predict the probability that a driver will initiate an auto insurance claim in the next year. Data source and original kaggle competition link [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/c/porto-seguro-safe-driver-prediction/overview/description)
  - [Supervised Learning: Credit Card Default Transaction Analysis and Prediction](https://github.com/nichowu/credit-card-default-analysis): A Mini Project that compares the performance of logistic regression, randome forest, SVM, XGBoost, LightGBM on Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset. Feature selection and hyperparameter tuning were also conducted to improve the model performance. 
  - [ML in the Cloud: Daily Rainfall Prediction](https://github.com/nichowu/Daily-Rainfall-Prediction): Deployed ensemble machine learning models in the cloud to predict daily rainfall in Australia on a large dataset

  _Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, AWS E3, RESTful API, PySpark_ 

- ### Natural Language Processing

  - Lots to do in near future
  - Stay tuned

  _Tools: NLTK, scikit_

- ### Data Analysis and Visualisation
  - [Advanced Data Visualization: Porto Seguro Safe Driver Prediction](https://github.com/nichowu/Porto-Seguro-Safe-Driver-Prediction/blob/main/porto-seguro-safe-driving-main.ipynb): An EDA with a focus on feature encoding and feature engineering exploration.
  - [Advanced Data Visualization: IEEE Fraud Detection Competition](https://github.com/nichowu/IEEE-CIS-Fraud-Detection/blob/main/IEEE-CIS-Fraud-Detection.ipynb): Exploratory data analysis on the IEEE fruad detection dataset. Data source and original kaggle competition link [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ieee-fraud-detection/overview)
  _Tools: Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib_
  
- ###  ETL & Database
    - [ETL_with_psycopg2_petl](https://github.com/nichowu/ETL_with_psycopg2_petl): A basic ETL building practice between Bank of Canada, local excel file, PostgreSQL in python with psycopg2 and petl.

- ###  Dashboard
    - [Dashboard in Dash: Country Happiness Dashboard App](https://github.com/nichowu/Country-Happiness-Dashboard-App): Present customized countries information through a series of data visualization tools such as world map, bar charts, box plot and comparison widget
